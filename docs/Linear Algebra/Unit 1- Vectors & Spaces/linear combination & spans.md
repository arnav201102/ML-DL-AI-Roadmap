# 🔹 LESSON 2: LINEAR COMBINATIONS & SPAN (COMPLETE)

## 1. Linear Combination

A linear combination:
[
a_1v_1+a_2v_2+\dots+a_nv_n
]

Meaning:

> Scale vectors and add them.

---

## 2. Span

The **span** of vectors is the **set of all linear combinations**.

### Geometric Meaning

| Vectors           | Span  |
| ----------------- | ----- |
| One               | Line  |
| Two independent   | Plane |
| Three independent | Space |

---

## 3. Examples

### Span of (1,0)

[
{(x,0)}
]
x-axis only.

---

### Span of (1,0),(0,1)

[
(x,y)
]
Entire ℝ².

---

### Span of (1,0),(2,0)

Still x-axis — no expansion.

---

## Practice Questions (WITH SOLUTIONS)

### Q1. Express (4,6) using (1,0) and (1,1)

Solve:

* a + b = 4
* b = 6
  → a = −2

[
-2(1,0)+6(1,1)=(4,6)
]

---

### Q2. Do (1,2) and (2,3) span ℝ²?

Yes — not scalar multiples.

---

### Q3. Describe span of (2,4)

Line through origin.

---

### Q4. If span(v₁,v₂)=span(v₁), what about v₂?

v₂ is dependent on v₁.

---

### Q5. Can one vector span ℝ³?

No — only a line.

---

## HOTS (ADVANCED) WITH SOLUTIONS

### HOTS 1

**Why does span always pass through the origin?**
Because linear combinations always include the zero vector.

---

### HOTS 2

**Why is span important for solution sets of equations?**
Solutions lie in the span of coefficient vectors.

---

### HOTS 3 (Hard)

**If span(v₁,v₂)=ℝ², must v₁ and v₂ be independent?**
Yes. Otherwise span collapses to a line.

## Key Concepts
A linear combination has the form:
a₁v₁ + a₂v₂ + ... + aₙvₙ

The span is the set of all possible linear combinations.

## Practice Questions with Solutions

### Basic

**Q1. Write a linear combination of (1,0) and (0,1).**  
**Solution:**  
2(1,0) + 3(0,1) = (2,3)

**Q2. What does span represent geometrically?**  
**Solution:**  
The region of space reachable using linear combinations of vectors.

---

### Intermediate

**Q3. What is the span of (1,0)?**  
**Solution:**  
All vectors of form (x,0) — the x-axis.

**Q4. Can (1,0) and (2,0) span R²?**  
**Solution:**  
No, they lie on the same line.

---

### Advanced

**Q5. Do (1,0) and (0,1) span R²?**  
**Solution:**  
Yes, any (x,y) can be written as x(1,0)+y(0,1)

**Q6. What happens to span if vectors are dependent?**  
**Solution:**  
Span remains same even if one vector is removed.
