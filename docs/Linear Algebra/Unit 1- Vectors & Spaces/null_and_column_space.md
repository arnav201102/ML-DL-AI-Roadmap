# Null Space and Column Space

## 1. Column Space
Column space = span of columns of A

---

## 2. Example: Column Space

A = [ 1  2 ]
    [ 0  0 ]

Columns:
(1,0), (2,0)

Column space = x-axis in ℝ²

---

## 3. Null Space
Null space = solutions of Ax = 0

---

## 4. Example: Null Space

Solve:
x₁ + 2x₂ = 0

x₁ = -2x₂

Null space:
{ (-2t, t) | t ∈ ℝ }

A line through origin → subspace.

---

## 5. Rank–Nullity Example

A has 2 columns  
Rank = 1  
Nullity = 1  

1 + 1 = 2 ✔

---

## 6. Interpretation
Column space → what outputs are possible  
Null space → which inputs do nothing
