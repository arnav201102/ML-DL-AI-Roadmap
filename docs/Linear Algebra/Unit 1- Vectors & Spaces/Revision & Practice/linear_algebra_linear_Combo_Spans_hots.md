## 🔹 HOTS (Higher Order Thinking Skills)

---

### **HOTS 1. Why does adding more vectors not always increase span?**

Because new vectors may lie inside the existing span.

**Insight:**

> Quantity ≠ new directions.

---

### **HOTS 2. Why is span considered a geometric object rather than a set of vectors?**

Because it describes a **continuous region** (line, plane, space), not just points.

---

### **HOTS 3. How does span help detect redundancy in features?**

If a feature lies in the span of others, it adds no new information.

---

### **HOTS 4. Why can’t curved shapes be represented using span?**

Linear combinations generate only **straight-line structures**.

---

### **HOTS 5. Why does every basis generate the same span?**

Because all bases represent **minimal, complete directions** of the space.

---

### **HOTS 6. How is span related to column space of a matrix?**

The column space **is** the span of the column vectors.

---

### **HOTS 7. Why does span ignore the order of vectors?**

Addition is commutative, so order does not affect combinations.

---

### **HOTS 8. Why is span invariant under scalar multiplication of generators?**

Scaling generators does not change reachable directions.

---

### **HOTS 9. Why does span grow only with independent vectors?**

Only independent vectors add new dimensions.

---

### **HOTS 10. Why is span central to understanding linear transformations?**

Because transformations map **one span to another**.

---

### **HOTS 11. Why does span help in understanding rank?**

Rank equals the dimension of the span.

---

### **HOTS 12. Why does removing redundant vectors simplify computation?**

It reduces dimensionality without losing information.

---

### **HOTS 13. Can two dependent vectors ever span a plane?**

❌ No — dependence limits span to a line.

---

### **HOTS 14. Why is span always infinite (unless only zero vector)?**

Scalars come from real numbers → infinite combinations.

---

### **HOTS 15 (Hard). If span(S) = span(T), what must be true about S and T?**

Each set’s vectors can be written as linear combinations of the other.

> **Linear combinations build vectors, span defines reach, and independence defines growth.**
