All x such that Ax = 0.

### 3. Is null space a subspace?

Yes.

### 4. Is column space a subspace?

Yes.

### 5. What does column space represent?

All achievable outputs.

### 6. What does null space represent?

Inputs with no effect.

### 7. What is rank?

Dimension of column space.

### 8. What is nullity?
