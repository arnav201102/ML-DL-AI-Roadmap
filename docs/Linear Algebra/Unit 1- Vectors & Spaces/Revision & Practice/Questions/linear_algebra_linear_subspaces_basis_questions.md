### 1. What is a subspace?

A subspace is a subset of a vector space that itself satisfies all vector space properties: it contains the zero vector, is closed under addition, and scalar multiplication.

### 2. Why must a subspace contain the zero vector?

Because closure under scalar multiplication requires that multiplying any vector by 0 yields the zero vector.

### 3. Is the x-axis in ℝ² a subspace?

Yes. It contains (0,0), is closed under addition, and scalar multiplication.

### 4. Why is a shifted line not a subspace?

It does not pass through the origin, so the zero vector is missing.

### 5. What is a basis?

A basis is a minimal set of linearly independent vectors that spans a space.

### 6. Can a subspace have multiple bases?

Yes, infinitely many.

### 7. What is the dimension of a subspace?

The number of vectors in any basis of the subspace.

### 8. Why can’t the zero vector be part of a basis?

Because it causes linear dependence.

### 9. Give a basis for ℝ².

{(1,0), (0,1)}

### 10. Can a plane in ℝ³ be a subspace?

Yes, if it passes through the origin.

### 11. What is the dimension of ℝ³?

3

### 12. Why do all bases have the same size?

This follows from a fundamental theorem of linear algebra.

### 13. Is every spanning set a basis?

No, it must also be linearly independent.

### 14. Why are bases important computationally?

They reduce infinite vectors into finite coordinates.

### 15. How is basis used in ML?

To remove redundant features and reduce dimensionality.
