## 🔹 HOTS (Higher Order Thinking Skills)

---

### **HOTS 1. Why does dependence always indicate redundancy but redundancy doesn’t always look obvious?**

Redundancy can be hidden through combinations, not just scalar multiples.

---

### **HOTS 2. Why is checking independence often easier than checking span?**

Independence requires checking **only one equation**, while span requires reachability of all vectors.

---

### **HOTS 3. Why can’t more than n vectors be independent in ( \mathbb{R}^n )?**

The space has only n degrees of freedom.

---

### **HOTS 4. Why does dependence reduce dimensionality?**

Redundant vectors fail to add new directions.

---

### **HOTS 5. Why is independence more important than number of vectors?**

Because unique directions matter, not quantity.

---

### **HOTS 6. Why does dependence affect invertibility of matrices?**

Dependent columns prevent one-to-one mapping.

---

### **HOTS 7. Why does independence guarantee unique coordinates?**

Each vector has exactly one representation in the basis.

---

### **HOTS 8. Why does removing a dependent vector not change the span?**

It contributes no new direction.

---

### **HOTS 9. Why does dependence imply rank deficiency?**

Rank counts independent vectors.

---

### **HOTS 10. Why is independence crucial in feature selection?**

It removes multicollinearity and noise.

---

### **HOTS 11. Why is geometric intuition powerful for dependence?**

It reveals overlapping directions visually.

---

### **HOTS 12. Can dependent vectors ever form a basis? Why?**

❌ No. A basis must be independent.

---

### **HOTS 13. Why does dependence cause instability in numerical systems?**

Small changes create large solution variations.

---

### **HOTS 14. Why is independence a prerequisite for diagonalization?**

Eigenvectors must be independent.

---

### **HOTS 15 (Hard). Can a set be independent but not span the space?**

✅ Yes. Example: one vector in ( \mathbb{R}^2 ).

> **Independence removes redundancy, dependence signals overlap, and basis balances both.**
