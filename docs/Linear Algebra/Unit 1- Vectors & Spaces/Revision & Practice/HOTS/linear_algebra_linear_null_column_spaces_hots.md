## Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS)

### 1. Why is null space always a subspace?

**Answer:**
Solutions to Ax=0 are closed under addition and scaling.

---

### 2. Why does non-trivial null space imply infinite solutions?

**Answer:**
Because free variables exist.

---

### 3. Why is column space linked to outputs?

**Answer:**
Ax is a linear combination of columns.

---

### 4. Why can’t row operations change null space structure?

**Answer:**
They preserve solution relationships.

---

### 5. Why does rank limit expressiveness?

**Answer:**
Lower rank → fewer independent outputs.

---

### 6. Why does full rank imply trivial null space?

**Answer:**
No free variables exist.

---

### 7. Why is null space critical for detecting redundancy?

**Answer:**
Redundant columns map to zero directions.

---

### 8. Why does rank-nullity always balance?

**Answer:**
Dimensions must account for all degrees of freedom.

---

### 9. Why is column space harder to visualize than null space?

**Answer:**
It lies in output space, not variable space.

---

### 10. Why does PCA shrink null space?

**Answer:**
It removes low-variance directions.

---

### 11. Why does zero matrix have maximal null space?

**Answer:**
All inputs map to zero.

---

### 12. Why does identity matrix have trivial null space?

**Answer:**
Only zero maps to zero.

---

### 13. Why is null space essential in optimization?

**Answer:**
It defines directions that don’t change output.

---

### 14. Why does column dependence reduce rank?

**Answer:**
Dependent columns add no new span.

---

### 15. Why is understanding spaces more important than solving equations?

**Answer:**
Spaces explain *why* solutions exist, not just *how*.
