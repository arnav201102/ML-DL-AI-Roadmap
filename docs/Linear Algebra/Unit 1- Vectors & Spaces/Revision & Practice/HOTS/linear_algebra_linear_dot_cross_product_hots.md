## Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS)

### 1. Why does dot product encode angle information?

**Answer:**
Because it directly incorporates cosθ, linking geometry and algebra.

---

### 2. Why is dot product zero insufficient to prove independence?

**Answer:**
Orthogonality does not imply spanning or independence beyond pairs.

---

### 3. Why is cross product restricted to ℝ³?

**Answer:**
It relies on a unique perpendicular direction, which exists only in 3D.

---

### 4. Why does |a×b| represent area?

**Answer:**
It equals base × height = |a||b|sinθ.

---

### 5. How does dot product enable projection?

**Answer:**
It measures how much one vector aligns with another.

---

### 6. Why is cosine similarity scale-invariant?

**Answer:**
Magnitude cancels out in normalization.

---

### 7. Why is dot product symmetric but cross product anti-symmetric?

**Answer:**
Dot product measures similarity; cross product encodes orientation.

---

### 8. Why does cross product direction matter in physics?

**Answer:**
It determines rotational direction (right-hand rule).

---

### 9. Why does dot(a,a) never become negative?

**Answer:**
Because it equals |a|² ≥ 0.

---

### 10. Why do parallel vectors have zero cross product?

**Answer:**
sinθ = 0 → no perpendicular area.

---

### 11. How does dot product detect correlation?

**Answer:**
High dot → strong alignment (used in ML).

---

### 12. Why is orthogonality powerful in computation?

**Answer:**
It eliminates interference between components.

---

### 13. Why do graphics engines use cross products heavily?

**Answer:**
To compute surface normals for lighting.

---

### 14. Why is angle more meaningful than magnitude in similarity?

**Answer:**
Magnitude depends on scale; angle captures direction.

---

### 15. Why are orthonormal bases ideal?

**Answer:**
They simplify dot products to direct coordinate reading.
