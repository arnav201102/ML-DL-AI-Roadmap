## Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS)

### 1. Why does every subspace have to pass through the origin?

**Answer:**
Because closure under scalar multiplication requires that multiplying any vector by 0 yields the zero vector. If zero is missing, scalar closure fails.

---

### 2. Can a finite set of vectors form an infinite subspace?

**Answer:**
Yes. A finite basis can generate infinitely many vectors via linear combinations.

---

### 3. Why is the empty set never a subspace?

**Answer:**
It does not contain the zero vector, which is mandatory.

---

### 4. Explain why a subspace cannot be “shifted.”

**Answer:**
Shifting removes the origin, violating subspace conditions.

---

### 5. Why does every basis have the same number of vectors?

**Answer:**
This follows from the **Basis Theorem**, ensuring dimension is invariant.

---

### 6. How does linear independence prevent redundancy?

**Answer:**
No vector can be written using others, ensuring each contributes new direction.

---

### 7. Can a subspace have more vectors than its parent space?

**Answer:**
No. A subspace’s dimension ≤ the dimension of the space.

---

### 8. Why is minimality essential in a basis?

**Answer:**
Without minimality, vectors become redundant and inefficient.

---

### 9. How does basis relate to coordinate systems?

**Answer:**
A basis defines how vectors are uniquely represented numerically.

---

### 10. Why are different bases useful in applications?

**Answer:**
Different bases simplify problems (e.g., eigenbasis in ML).

---

### 11. Can two different subspaces share the same basis?

**Answer:**
Only if they are the same subspace.

---

### 12. Why does adding a dependent vector never increase dimension?

**Answer:**
It adds no new direction.

---

### 13. Explain basis in terms of compression.

**Answer:**
Basis vectors store maximum information with minimum data.

---

### 14. Why is basis central to PCA?

**Answer:**
PCA finds an optimal basis that captures variance.

---

### 15. How does basis choice affect numerical stability?

**Answer:**
Poor bases amplify errors; orthonormal bases reduce them.
