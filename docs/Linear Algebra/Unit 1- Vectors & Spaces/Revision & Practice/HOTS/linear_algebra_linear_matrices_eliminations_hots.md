## Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS)

### 1. Why do row operations preserve solution sets?

**Answer:**
They represent algebraically equivalent equations.

---

### 2. Why does a pivot represent a constraint?

**Answer:**
Each pivot fixes one variable’s value.

---

### 3. Why do free variables imply infinite solutions?

**Answer:**
They allow continuous degrees of freedom.

---

### 4. Why is RREF preferred over REF?

**Answer:**
It gives solutions directly without back-substitution.

---

### 5. Why does a zero row indicate redundancy?

**Answer:**
It adds no new information.

---

### 6. Why does inconsistency appear as [0 0 | c]?

**Answer:**
It implies 0 = c, which is impossible.

---

### 7. Why does elimination outperform substitution?

**Answer:**
It scales efficiently to large systems.

---

### 8. Why is matrix form essential for computers?

**Answer:**
It enables vectorized computation.

---

### 9. Why do pivots define rank?

**Answer:**
Each pivot corresponds to an independent constraint.

---

### 10. Why does row swapping not affect solutions?

**Answer:**
Equation order is irrelevant.

---

### 11. Why is elimination foundational for ML?

**Answer:**
Regression solves linear systems.

---

### 12. Why does overdetermined system often have no solution?

**Answer:**
Too many constraints cause conflict.

---

### 13. Why is numerical stability an issue in elimination?

**Answer:**
Small pivots amplify rounding errors.

---

### 14. Why are augmented matrices powerful?

**Answer:**
They unify equations and constants.

---

### 15. Why does elimination reveal structure of solutions?

**Answer:**
It exposes rank, nullity, and dependencies.
