# Vector Dot and Cross Products

## 1. Dot Product
a · b = |a||b|cosθ

### Coordinate Formula
a · b = a₁b₁ + a₂b₂ (+ a₃b₃)

---

## 2. Example: Dot Product

Let:
a = (1,2), b = (3,4)

a · b = (1)(3) + (2)(4) = 11

Since dot product ≠ 0, vectors are not perpendicular.

---

## 3. Example: Orthogonality

a = (1,2), b = (2,-1)

a · b = 2 - 2 = 0  
✅ Vectors are perpendicular.

---

## 4. Cross Product (ℝ³ only)

a × b gives a vector perpendicular to both.

---

## 5. Example: Cross Product

a = (1,0,0), b = (0,1,0)

a × b = (0,0,1)

Magnitude = 1 → unit normal vector.

## 6. Applications
- Physics: torque = r × F
- Graphics: lighting normals
- Robotics: orientation control
